## Commentary

There are a lot of people out there using WPF but the web has lost some of its best resources over the years
and Microsoft isn't putting out much new WPF content (even if it will be supported for decades to come).
One of my goals in sharing this is to provide a working app that might help guide someone who needs to
see examples of WPF in action.
